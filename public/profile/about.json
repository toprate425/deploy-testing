    "about": "I graduated from two IT engineering colleges. During that time, I had Bachelor of Science and Master of Computer Application (MCA).\n I have worked in full stack engineering for my entire over 8 years career and my commitment to critical thinking and attention to detail have gotten me to where the frontend developer in IT Partner company. I am a self-motivated, energetic collaborator who thrives on working in a fast-paced environment with tight deadlines and have a desire to stay updated on current and new technologies. So I have engaged as a role of leader in this company, contributing to make an innovative result and better progress. Due to pandemic, I had to end up my role in this company earlier, and now I am working as Frontend developer via Remote. I have keen insight into what it takes to run a successful project because I have taken part in different successful projects across from startup to multi vendors.\n My career goal is to have an opportunity to learn and grow my skills from a technical standpoint, and a chance to learn more skills over time. I'd love to work for the company, innovative and ready to expand.",
